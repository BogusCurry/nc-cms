About nc-cms

nc-cms is a website Content Management System (CMS) designed with the primary goals of being user friendly and quick to integrate, while retaining the most important features of a modern day CMS. nc-cms is an open source and free to use project licensed under the zlib/libpng license. nc-cms was written in PHP and will run on any web server that supports PHP 5 or higher.

nc-cms can optionally use a database for content storage (MySQL, etc.). However, a database is not required, and nc-cms uses a super fast flat file system by default.

    * Smooth user experience. nc-cms was intuitively designed for ease of use by the end user, and features a very small learning curve for people who edit content.
    * Fast installation and integration. Drop the nc-cms folder into your website directory, add a few lines of code to your existing web page(s), and you are finished!
    * Flexible. Manage as little or as much of your website as you like. nc-cms acts as a page add-on and won't command the underlying structure of your website.
    * Expandable. nc-cms's codebase is clean, lightweight and open. This makes nc-cms a great foundation for building upon.
    * Efficient. Because of the inherit design choices used in nc-cms, it is one of the fastest non-caching CMS's in the world.
